        <span>Computer Science Student</span>
        <p>Great to meet you, my name is Ziyad Mohammed! I'm a third-year computer science student at Unity University, and I absolutely love coding in different programming languages.

            From a young age, I've been fascinated by the world of technology and how it can be used to solve complex problems. As I delved deeper into the field of computer science, I quickly discovered my passion for programming. There's nothing quite like the feeling of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life on the screen.
            
            As a student, I've worked hard to maintain a GPA of 3.98, and I'm proud of my academic achievements so far.
            
            <br> But for me, coding is about more than just getting good grades. It's about constantly pushing myself to learn new things and improve my skills. Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating with others, I always strive to deliver high-quality code that meets the needs of the user.
            
            In my free time, you can usually find me tinkering with new programming languages or experimenting with different frameworks and libraries. I also enjoy attending hackathons and other coding events, where I can connect with like-minded individuals and work on exciting projects.
            
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to get in touch!</p>
